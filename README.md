# MATH-219 Data Science Project

#### Data Provided by: Department of Education
#### Dataset Owner: Delaware Open Data

## Introduction

* This file contains the number of tested students, proficient students, and the corresponding proficiency rate for the key annual assessments administered during a given school year.
* Each row is a single represents the proficiency rate for a specified group of students within a school, its district, or the state as a whole.


## Preprocessing
Include all steps for creating/merging frames, type conversions, and anything else needed to prepare the data for analysis.
Remove any columns that are not meaningful or otherwise of interest.
Detect missing values and, if any are found, remove or replace them. 
Perform an outlier analysis on all quantitative columns. (This is descriptive and does not require action to remove the values unless they clearly indicate missing data.)

## Summary data analysis
Make a statistical summary of every column using numerical and graphical components.
Explore correlations between at least 3 pairs of quantitative columns.

## Discussion
### Pose two questions about this dataset that you could explore in future projects. One question should be about the prediction of a categorical outcome. For example:

Do the occurrence rates of these 50 words predict whether an email is marked as spam?
Do diagnosis, age, zip code, income, race, and gender predict whether cancer treatment is successful, as measured by 5-year survival rate?
Do family size, income, postal code, GPA, and parents' education levels and occupations predict whether someone goes to college?

### The other question should be about the prediction of a quantitative outcome, such as:

Can last year's team points scored, points allowed, and record, combined with this year's player retention and injury data, predict this year's record?
Do a movie's length, genre, and release date, along with the popularity of its director and stars, predict its box office take?  

### Note that these questions are not necessarily about cause and effect, simply about whether knowing some information allows you to deduce other information.

## Some considerations:

Your questions should be plausible and not propose nonsensical or impossible correlations.
The proposed  predictions should be based on at least 4 quantitative features (i. e., dataset columns).
Stay away from questions based on progression over time, such as stock prices. These often require different methods than the ones we will study. However, a before/after question might work, e. g., effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Good questions are often about using mundane or readily available information to deduce something that is interesting and not obvious. But even a common-sense proposal could be worthwhile if it means quantifying an effect that "everybody knows."
